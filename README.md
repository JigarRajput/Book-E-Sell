# This is frontend of Book-E-Sale 

## So what's inside it?
This is basically an e-commerce web-app developed using Reactjs alog with using a bit of redux in the frontend side and I have used springboot (you know 'cause I love Java) for developing REST apis.

### I have deployed both REST api and frontend on heroku. Following are the links you can visit my project.
