# This is frontend of Book-E-Sale 

## So what's inside it?
This is basically an e-commerce web-app developed using Reactjs along with a bit of react-redux in the frontend side and I have used springboot (you know 'cause I love Java) for developing REST apis.

### I have deployed both REST api and frontend on heroku. Following are the links you can visit my project.

### [Complete Application](https://book-baazar.herokuapp.com/)
### [REST API](https://rest-api-tatvasoft.herokuapp.com/)

### following endpoint is working and useable simply by browser

### /getbooks 
#### gives all the books available in the database 
there are other endpoints too but they are POST end points so...

### And by the way it is the first live project (deployed one ðŸ˜…) of my life !!
